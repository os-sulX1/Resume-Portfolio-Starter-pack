    "bio": "Hello, I'm Sultan Saleh, a Fullstack Developer with a deep passion for React, Next.js, and React Native. With over a year of experience in web development, I truly \"eat, sleep, and breathe\" these technologies. I specialize in creating responsive web interfaces, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless user experiences. My expertise extends to designing and implementing APIs with Express.js and managing databases using ORMs like Prisma and Drizzle. Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications and marketplace applications. I utilize modern technologies such as Stripe, Kinde, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS to build innovative solutions. Recently, I've focused on developing unique SaaS apps with AI-powered features, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech industry. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Arab Open University in Jeddah, with a GPA of 3.06 out of 4.00. Additionally, I am Google IT Support and CompTIA Security+ certified, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning and professional growth. My journey in web and mobile application development is driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to share knowledge with the tech community. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.",
